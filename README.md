# gradient-vector-font

An open font in the style of the 70s / 80s vector arcade games.

Created for the [Gradient Descent](https://github.com/IMAGINARY/gradient-descent) game, 
part of the [I AM A.I. exhibition](http://i-am.ai/).

Two weights are provided: Light and Regular.

Only has uppercase letters, for historical reasons, some basic ASCII characters and:

- German language characters (ß, umlauts)
- Spanish language characters (accents, eñe, ü)
- French language characters (including æ and œ!)

Included:

- OTF files
- Webfont (WOFF and WOFF2 plus CSS)
- Source Adobe Illustrator files (with some ugly details if you look at it closely, sorry).
